This app is a picture-sharing site devoid of text and navigated entirely by pictures and icons in order to maximize accessible to people who don't speak English, children, and people with disabilities. A user is able to submit and tag their pictures via icons and then use those icon tags in order to search for pictures of that category.

Future features will include a drag and drop field to upload files, a slide show on the front page with a random selection of one picture from each category, and an external API linking to Imgur.
